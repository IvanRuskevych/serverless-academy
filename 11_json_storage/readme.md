# TASK 11. JSON STORAGE

In this task you need to create a full clone of jsonbase.com

## Requirements

Your app should consist of two endpoints

- `PUT /<json_path>` - Allows a user to store the JSON document
- `GET /<json_path>` - Allows a user to access previously stored JSON
  You can use either express or Koa framework.

## To run application:

- Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
- Create an `.env` based on its `.env.sample` example
- Start the server using `npm start` for production or `npm run dev` for development with nodemon.
